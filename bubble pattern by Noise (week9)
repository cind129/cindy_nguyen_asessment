Code 1: Bubbles pattern by Noise in Touch Designer (week 9)
I have created a visual effect that resembles soft, floating bubbles, akin to droplets drifting in space, using Touch Designer. This is one of my favourite codes in all the code that Iâ€™ve made so far in Touch Designer. Looking at how the bubbles move and glow gives me a feeling of dreaminess, magic, and like floating in water. 
I create this by using Noise and Feedback loop. I add noise to the main images, making them translate in slow motion like fluid. Then, I apply effects like edge or blur to make the colors inside more translucent, softening and brightening the outlines to give the bubbles a glowing aura.
Then put it back to feedback loop, making the animation move smoothly and spread over time. I feel like that slow, mesmerizing movement has a kind of magical, flowing energy to it, make me so satisfied every time I see it.
