Selection 1: Rippling water effect by Noise
I chose this code project because it is the first lesson that I learned about Perlin Noise and how to use it to create something that is creative. 
Although the process was a bit difficult to write the code, I really enjoyed with the result. I have created a series of circles that are gradually bigger with alternating blue and white colors.
These circle looks like ripples on the surface when water drops, and they are meant to vibrate gently to make the effect of water ripples.
To make that, I use For() loop to draw each circle, gradually decreasing its size, then call Noise function and apply it to the radius, to give the circle itself a subtle movement, creating a slight oscillation for each circle over time. The result is a calm, wave-like animation. The rings move together in a smooth, harmonious way, just like soft ripples spreading out on water.
While the results were pretty good, I found that I still needed to learn and develop to use Noise more skillfully, and learn how to combine it with the skills I learned in the process to create something more dynamic and complex generative art.
